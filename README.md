# BC19 Seeds Catalog

Has a catalog of seeds for <a href='https://battlecode.org'>Battlecode 2019</a> maps

Can search for seeds that have 1,2, or 3 castles, and whether pathing may be difficult or not.

Also has a visualizer for a given seed, showing what the map looks like and initial positions of castles, fuel, and karbonite.
